# 3 mins CSS

This is the source code for the series "3 mins CSS". 

Please be aware that this repository **DOES NOT** include any images used in the project. This repository is just for the showcase of TailwindCSS code since I purchased most of the illustration's license and did not allow it to redistribute on Github. If you have any questions, let me know by opening issues or commenting on videos.
